<h1>Automated Email Form Integration</h1>
This project automates the process of filling out a web form using Selenium WebDriver in Python. 
It fetches data from a JSON file (extracted_data.json) and populates the form fields on a web page (form.html) accordingly. 
The Selenium WebDriver interacts with the web browser to simulate user actions and automate the form filling process.

<h1>Prerequisites</h1>
<h5>Before running the Selenium script, ensure you have the following:</h5>

<p>1. Python installed on your system</p>
<p> 2. Selenium WebDriver for Python (selenium) installed via pip install selenium</p>
<p>3. ChromeDriver (or WebDriver for your preferred browser) downloaded and added to your system PATH</p>
